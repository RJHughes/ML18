    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color='red'>We have split Assignment 4 into two parts to make it easier for you to work on them separately and for the markers to give you feedback. This is part A of Assignment 4 and deals with the News-Group Dataset - Part B deals with the MNIST dataset. Both Assignments together are still worth 50% of CourseWork 2. **Remember to submit both notebooks (you can submit them separately).**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation: **in questions where this is specified, you will be penalised if you go over.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to distinguish between **attributes** (columns of the data) and **features** (which typically refers only to the independent variables, i.e. excluding the target variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you must NOT borrow actual text or code from others. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any). Please refer to the [Academic Misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct) page for what consistutes a breach of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 15/11/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file(s) again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.**: This Assignment requires submitting **two files (electronically as described below)**:\n",
    " 1. This Jupyter Notebook for Part A, *and*\n",
    " 1. The Jupyter Notebook for Part B\n",
    " \n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook (as well as Part B), making sure to:\n",
    "   1. save it with **all code/text and visualisations**: markers are NOT expected to run any cells,\n",
    "   1. keep the name of the file **UNCHANGED**, *and*\n",
    "   1. **keep the same structure**: retain the questions, **DO NOT** delete any cells and **avoid** adding unnecessary cells unless absolutely necessary, as this makes the job harder for the markers.\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. Submit it using the `submit` functionality. To do this, you must be on a DICE environment. Open a Terminal, and:\n",
    "   1. **On-Campus Students**: navigate to the location of this notebook and execute the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      ```submit iaml cw2 04_A_KMeans.ipynb 04_B_PCA.ipynb```\n",
    "      \n",
    "   1. **Distance Learners:** These instructions also apply to those students who work on their own computer. First you need to copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command). For this, you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example. Replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details: i.e. if your student number is for example s1234567, then `[YOUR USERNAME]` becomes `s1234567`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 04_A_KMeans.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:04_A_KMeans.ipynb\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 04_B_PCA.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:04_B_PCA.ipynb\n",
    "    ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "    ssh student.login\n",
    "    submit iaml cw2 04_A_KMeans.ipynb 04_B_PCA.ipynb\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "   What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You should receive an automatic email confirmation after submission.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%. Both Part A (this notebook) and Part B are each worth 50% of the Total Mark for Assignment 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "In this part of the assignment we will cluster the observations in the 20 Newsgroups dataset using the k-means algorithm. Each row of the dataset represents a document with bag of words features. If we were not given the labels for each document (i.e. the newsgroup it came from), clustering could allow us to infer which documents should have the same label. Observing common words within each cluster may allow us to give meaning to these inferred labels too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In contrast to Assignment 1**, we have opted to use tf-idf weights ([term frequency - inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)) for each word instead of the frequency counts (which is why we will be downloading it anew). These weights represent the importance of a word to a document with respect to a collection of documents. The importance increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and decreases proportionally to the number of times the word appears in the whole corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally we preprocess the data to include the most frequent 1000 words that appear in more than two documents, less than half of all documents, and that are not [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words). We have provided the code for this preprocessing for you."

The training data doesn't indicate anything obviously wrong, but it's hard to tell without looking up the specifics of the tf-idf algorithm. It does however seem strange that the max for some features is orders of magnitude greater than the mean. There is also at least one feature with a max value of 1, which might be worth checking out.

    "(b) This is an interesting plot that supports the evidence given from the ARI that the algorithm isn't doing a particularly good job at clustering the data. However, note that it has in general clustered the alt.atheism class succesfully in bin 4 while bins 0 and and 3 are all also well clustered even though they contain two classes, as we know that these classes are similar (comp and rec). Where the algorithm let's us down severely is in bin one, which gives almost an even split between the three classes. Even though there is some good clustering going on, the ARI algorithm doesn't take into account the similarity of the classes and hence returns a relatively poor score. "

That is, while we cannot visualise a 1000-feature space, we can pick the top two components and visualise those. We will do this by means of a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), which we will use to analyse the cluster centres.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(a)** [Text] By explaining what a Voronoi Diagram is, indicate why it is useful in visualising the extent (in space) of K-Means clusters?<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(b)** [Code] Using the function `plot_voronoi` which we provided in the `utils` package, visualise the clusters in the two-dimensional PCA space (top two components). Mark each cluster centre, and visualise **some** (*Hint: sub-sample*) of the data points to give you an idea of where the true classes lie. Make sure that the key elements of the plot are clearly visible/discernible (you may need to tweak some parameters) and label clearly all necessary elements of the plot (color-coding, data points). *Tip: you may need to change y to a numeric value if using matplotlib rather than seaborn*.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(c)** [Text] What can you conclude from the plot as to the `classification-performance` of the K-Means classifier?"
